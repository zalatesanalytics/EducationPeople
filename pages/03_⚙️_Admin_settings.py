This page is the **admin/configuration** placeholder.

Future roadmap for EducationPeople MEAL system:

- Configure data sources (KoboToolbox, SurveyMonkey, Excel upload rules)  
- Manage EducationPeople's organizational indicator dictionary  
- Run data quality checks (gender completeness, missing values, duplicates)  
- Configure user roles & access levels  

For now, this page documents that the system is designed to be **scalable and extensible**.
